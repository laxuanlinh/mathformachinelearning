# `Linear Algebra II`

## `Affine transformation`

- Is the transformation that changes the geometry of vectors, adjusts their angles or distances but still preserves their parallelism
  $$v = \begin{bmatrix}
    3, 1
  \end{bmatrix}$$ 
  $$I = \begin{bmatrix}
    1&0\\
    0&-1
  \end{bmatrix}$$
  $$
    I_v = v.I = \begin{bmatrix}
    3, -1
    \end{bmatrix}
  $$
- `Affine transformation` could include:
  - Flipping a vector over axes
  - Scaling
  - Shearing
  - Rotation
- Many transformations can be applied to a vector simultaneously
